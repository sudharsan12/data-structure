A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of finite set of vertices(nodes)
and a set of edges connecting them.
         A---------------B
         |\               | \
         |  \             |  \
         |    \           |   E
         |       \        |  /
         |          \     | /
         C---------------D


  
vertices - where data is stored ex: A,B,C,D
Edges- which connect the vertics line b/w the alphabets
